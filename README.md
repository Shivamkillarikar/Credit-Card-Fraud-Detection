# Loan Approval Prediction  

## Overview  
This project predicts loan approval outcomes based on applicant details. Using a dataset of past applications, the model identifies key factors influencing approvals and applies logistic regression to deliver accurate predictions.  

## Features  
- **Data Preprocessing**: Handled missing values, encoded categorical variables, and scaled numerical features.  
- **Feature Engineering**: Selected and transformed features to enhance model performance.  
- **Machine Learning**: Applied logistic regression for prediction, achieving robust performance metrics.  

## Tools & Technologies  
- **Programming Language**: Python  
- **Libraries**:  
  - NumPy and pandas for data manipulation.  
  - scikit-learn for model development and evaluation.  
- **Environment**: Jupyter Notebook  

## Dataset  
The dataset is chosen from kaggle ,name as credit card fraud detection dataset.


## Model Evaluation  
The model's performance was evaluated using metrics like:  
- **Accuracy**  
- **Precision**  



   ```  

## Results  
The logistic regression model demonstrated effective prediction capabilities, making it suitable for deployment in loan approval systems.  

## Future Improvements  
- Experimenting with other machine learning algorithms such as decision trees and random forests.  
- Enhancing feature selection to improve accuracy further.  
- Implementing a front-end interface for better user interaction.
